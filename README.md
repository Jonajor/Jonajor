### ðŸ”­ Projects
- **Migration of Legacy Systems - Mercado Libre, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil**: In this project, I was responsible for refactoring the core invoice system of the platform, which allowed me to discontinue 140 endpoints out of 147 endpoints and allowed me to establish strong communication frameworks between the microservices of the billing platform. In addition, we managed to make our systems start to respond to requests for generating invoices from all Latin American countries where Mercado Livre operates.

- **Brazilian instant payment (PIX) - ItaÃº Unibanco, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil**: In this project, I participated in the implementation and development of the instant payment system (PIX) at ItaÃº Unibanco. My team and I were responsible for designing, coding and maintaining the instant payment platform's scheduling systems. I was also able to participate in the development of the central flow of instant payments. In this project, I worked with technologies such as Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Python, AWS services, Kafka in addition to working with distributed systems.

- **Digital Bank (ITI) - ItaÃº Unibanco, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil**: In this project, I participated in the creation of ItaÃº Unibanco's digital bank, ITI. My team and I were responsible for developing the QR Code payment system and interbank money transfer to the digital bank (ITI). In these projects we developed several Rest APIs based on Java, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

- **Migration of Legacy Systems - ItaÃº Unibanco, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil**: In this project, I participated in the migration of legacy payments systems such as the migration of the transfer system (TED) from Cobol to cloud-based Java microservices. I also participated in the migration of payment systems for invoices and the scheduling system.
